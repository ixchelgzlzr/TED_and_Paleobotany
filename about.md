**Bayesian total-evidence dating** has recently emerged as one of the best strategies for
dating phylogenetic trees. However, while numerous studies have applied these models of
time estimation to animals, plants face a slower application of these methodologies. In
addition, plant fossils can be particularly challenging because of the fragmentary nature
of the fossil material and the small number of fossils available. In practice, divergence time
estimation in plant clades requires expertise in paleobotany, systematics, phylogenetics
and statistics. Our workshop aims to provide a space for phylogeneticists interested in
paleobotany and Bayesian total-evidence dating to: 

1) discuss challenges and learn tools to extract character information from plant fossils.

2) explore statistical methods to cluster fossils and extant taxa.

3) get a theoretical and practical introduction to total-evidence dating using the software RevBayes.

See our
[Schedule](/schedule.md) for a more more details on the topics covered.
