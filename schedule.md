## When and where

This workshop will take place on **Friday 24th** from **9 am to 5 pm** as part of the **Evolution 2022** Conference. During the morning, we will provide an introduction to paleobotany,
morphological characters and statistical methods to cluster fossils with extant taxa. The
afternoon will be focused on divergence time estimation using the software 
<a href="https://revbayes.github.io">RevBayes</a>.

This webpage will serve as a repository of the materials used in the workshop. All the content and lectures will be available here.
